      Python is a repo for my own experimentation throught learning Python
      ====================================================================

![3D Cube in Python3](gif/cube.gif)

Last a 3D Python3 cube all rewritten and corrected with pylint-3.6

Most of the stuff in that repo is my own works because of modification bring
on the original code.

Most of time the original code was written in python2 and just not works in
python3.

All of what could be considered as my own works is under GNU GPL V3 or later.

Information on some of the software you can find in the PyREx repository


All the py3 socket server works with the py3 socket client.

It could happen that if you use a socket server then try to start another one
after, it will not want because the port will be already in use.

Search and kill the process will clear the situation.
